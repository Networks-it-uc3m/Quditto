# Quditto â€“ Experiment YAMLs for Reproducibility

This folder contains the YAML configuration files used for the three validation experiments presented in our paper on **Quditto**, which is currently submitted and under peer review.

## Purpose

We are sharing these configuration files to promote **transparency** and **reproducibility** of our results. Each YAML file corresponds to one of the three experimental validations described in the paper.

These configurations reflect the exact setups used during the experimental runs.


## Paper Access

The paper is currently under review. Upon acceptance and publication, we would provide the link here.
